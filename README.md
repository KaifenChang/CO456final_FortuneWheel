### How to run the script :
`./run.sh`

***
### My strategy:
Since this is a 60-second short game with the must capture variant. Speed and stability is the priority in my design.

As a one person team relying on non-fancy python coding skill. For the forced capture, I prioritize the capture with the highest value. Then if no forced capture, I randomly choose a move. **Greedy Strategy** is my best move to reach a **Nash Equilibrium**. My utility function is securing the participation grade. By playing fast with simple architecture, at least I can get the points and my opponent won't be worse off. 

```
In my mind, never underestimate the power of randomness, even with pseudo-randomness generated by computers. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
